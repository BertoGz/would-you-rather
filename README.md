# Would You Rather Project

This project was created for Udacity's React-Redux course final.  The objective was to
use the redux store to be able to create a manageable single-page application.
In this application the user can view polls and vote.  The user can also create polls, and view a
leaderboard. The app has the functionality of logging in as different users, with the same data being
shown regardless of user.
